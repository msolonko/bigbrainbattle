# BigBrainBattle (B^3)
This was our project for HackMIT 2019

This is a tool meant for elementary school students where they can practice their arithmetic skills in an entertaining way by training a virtual brain (which is powered by actual neural networks). 

We used Flask for Python and bootstrap for the frontend.
